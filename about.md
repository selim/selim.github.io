                    My journey into software began with IBM mainframe Assembly in 1989. In the early 1990s, work continued with IBM CICS/MVS and CSP, developing highly regulated software for the Defense Industry and Public Hospitals. By the mid-1990s, C++ and Java opened the door to projects for banks and large-scale enterprises. From 2010 onward, as a founder and manager, the focus shifted to building solutions for universities with the .NET ecosystem. Since 2021, the path has expanded into consultancy and investment. Today, with artificial intelligence and AI Agents becoming part of everyday work, the journey feels more exciting than ever. The future will belong to those who can think and create.
